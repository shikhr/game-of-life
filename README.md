# Conway's Game Of life

## Rules

- **Alive cell** – Fewer than 2 alive neighbours – **dies** (underpopulation).
- **Alive cell** – 2 or 3 neighbours – continues to **live** (perfect situation).
- **Alive cell** – More than 3 alive neighbours – **dies** (overpopulation).
- **Dead cell** – Exactly three alive neighbours – becomes **alive** (reproduction).
